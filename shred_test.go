// Ideas for tests

// Empty file
// File of the executable itself
// File does not exist
// File is a folder
// File is already open somewhere else
// Regular small file
// Very large file
// Executable/Image test?
// Garbage file
// File does not have writing permissions
// Requires super user priveleges
